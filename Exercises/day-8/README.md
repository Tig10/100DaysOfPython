## Prime Numbers

# Instructions

A Prime number is a number that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Number)

**You need to write a function** that checks whether the number passed into it is a prime
number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2. But 4 is not a prime number 
because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called on the last line of code.
3. Use the same wording as the Example Ouputs to make sure the tests pass.
